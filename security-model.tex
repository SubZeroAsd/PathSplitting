\section{Security and Privacy Model}
\label{sec:security-model}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:model-prelims}

We formalize the security and privacy notions of a multi-path payment channel network (MPPCN) 
and multi-path multi-hop locks (\sysname). We make use of the universal composability (UC) 
framework of Canetti \cite{canetti}. Our ideal functionalities work in interaction with 
a universe of users $\mathbb{U}$, and with an adversary $\sdv$.

\paragraph{Attacker Model}
We model parties as interactive Turing machines (ITMs), which communicate with a trusted 
functionality $\FF$ via secure and authenticated communication channels. We model the 
adversary $\sdv$ as a $\ppt$ machine that has access to an interface $\corrupt(\cdot)$, 
which takes as input a party identifier $P$ and provides the attacker with the internal 
state of $P$. From that point onward, all subsequent incoming and outgoing communication 
of $P$ is routed through $\sdv$. We consider the static corruption model, that is, the 
adversary is required to commit to the identifiers of the parties it wishes to corrupt 
ahead of time.

\paragraph{Communication Model}
%Communication happens through the secure transmission functionality $\FF_{\smt}$, as 
%defined in \cite{canetti}, which informs the adversary whenever a communication between 
%any two parties happens, and allows the adversary to delay the delivery of the messages 
%arbitrarily. However, the adversary can neither read nor change the content of the messages.

We consider a synchronous communication network, where communication proceeds in discrete 
rounds. We follow \cite{kmtz}, which in turn follows \cite{mpvsc}, and formalizes the notion of 
rounds via an ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{clock}}$, which represents the clock. The ideal 
functionality requires all honest parties to indicate that they are ready to proceed to the next 
round before the clock is ticked. Similar to \cite{mpvsc}, we treat the clock functionality as a 
global ideal functionality defined in global UC (GUC) model \cite{guc}. This implies that all 
parties are aware of the given round. 

We assume that the parties are connected via authenticated communication channels with guaranteed 
delivery of exactly one round. Hence, if a party $P$ sends a message $m$ to party $Q$ in round 
$r$, party $Q$ receives the message at the beginning of round $r + 1$. Furthermore, $Q$ is sure 
that the message was sent by $P$. The adversary can change the order of messages that were sent 
in the same round, but it cannot modify, delay or drop messages sent between parties, or it 
cannot insert a new message. For simplicity, we assume that computation is instantaneous. These 
assumptions on the communication channels are formalized as an ideal functionality 
$\FF_{\mathsf{GDC}}$, as defined in \cite{mpvsc}.

Additionally, we use the secure transmission functionality $\FF_{\smt}$, as defined in 
\cite{canetti}, which ensures that the adversary change the content of the messages.

\TODOE{Figure out whether we actually need $\FF_{\smt}$ and/or $\FF_{\anon}$ for the sake of 
privacy (currently we only use $\FF_{\smt}$ in our lock ideal functionality 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$).}
%\MESSAGEP{Do we really need $\FF_{\anon}$?}
%\MESSAGEE{I think you use anonymous communication channel in your constructions in the CCS paper when senders sends data to the intermediaries and the receiver. Since the sender knows and prepares the whole path, you need to use it there to achieve any meaningful anonymity at all. However, in our case the sender does not know the whole path, so only talks with the receiver and its direct neighbors. Therefore, we may not need to use anonymous communication channel. But, we need to further discuss this to clarify what form of anonymity we are aiming for and achieving and whether we need anonymous communication channels to realize them.}
%Furthermore, we assume existence of an anonymous communication channel as defined in 
%\cite{cl}, which we denote here as $\FF_{\anon}$. In the ideal functionality we use the 
%interfaces send$_\smt$ and receive$_\smt$ to exchange messages through the $\FF_{\smt}$ 
%functionality, and interfaces send$_\anon$ and receive$_\anon$ to exchange messages via 
%$\FF_{\anon}$.

\paragraph{Payment Channel and Ledger Functionality}
We make use of the payment channel functionality defined in \MESSAGEE{Generalized Bitcoin-Compatible Channels paper}, which we denote here as $\FF_{\GC}$. This ideal 
functionality uses internally a ledger functionality define in GUC and denoted as $\FF_\LL$.
It maintains a transaction set $\mathtt{TX}$, which stores all the transactions that have 
happened. Furthermore, $\FF_{\GC}$ maintains a set $\Gamma$, where it stores the active 
channels in their latest state. $\FF_{\GC}$ defines a channel $\gamma$ as an attribute tuple 
$(\gamma.\cid, \gamma.\users, \gamma.\cash, \gamma.\st)$, where $\gamma.\cid \in \{0,1\}^*$ is 
the channel identifier, $\gamma.\users \in \mathbb{U}^2$ defines the identities of the channel 
users, $\gamma.\cash \in \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ represents the total amount of coins locked in 
this channel, and $\gamma.\st = (\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n)$ is the state of the channel 
composed of a list of outputs. Each output $\theta_i$ has two attributes: the value $\theta_i.
\cash \in \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$, representing the amount of coins, and the function $\theta_i.
\varphi \colon \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}$, representing the spending condition of the output. 
%For convenience, $\FF_{\GC}$ defines the function $\gamma.\otherParty \colon \gamma.\users \to 
%\gamma.\users$ as $\gamma.\otherParty(P) = Q$ for $\gamma.\users = \{P,Q\}$.

%We assume existence of a blockchain $\BB$, modeled as a trusted append-only bulletin board. 
%The corresponding ideal functionality $\FF_{\BB}$, as modeled in \cite{perun}, is used to 
%store, read and update the balance of every user. It is defined in the 
%global UC (GUC) model \cite{guc}, since it provides data that should be globally accessible, 
%and it can be updated by multiple instances of our ideal functionality or by other protocols 
%simultaneously. We denote the number of entries in $\BB$ as $|\BB|$, and we model time as the 
%number of entries of the blockchain $\BB$ (i.e., time $t = |\BB|$).

\paragraph{Universal Composability}
We now review the notion of secure realization in the UC framework~\cite{canetti}. 
Intuitively, a protocol realizes an ideal functionality if the environment has no way 
to distinguish between the ideal functionality and the real-world protocol, where 
a simulator is in charge of translating the messages produced by the ideal functionality 
for the computational adversary. Here $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ denotes the ensemble of 
the outputs of the environment $\dist$ when interacting with the adversary $\adv$ and 
users running protocol $\pi$.

\begin{definition}[Universal Composability]
A protocol $\pi$ UC-realizes an ideal functionality $\FF$ if for any $\ppt$ adversary 
$\adv$ there exists a simulator $\sdv$, such that for any environment $\dist$, the 
ensembles $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ and $\exec_{\FF, \sdv, \dist}$ are computationally 
indistinguishable.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Multi-Path Payment Channel Network (MPPCN)}
\label{sec:mppcn}

In this section we define an ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ for MPPCNs. 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ works in interaction with a universe of users $\mathbb{U}$, and with an 
adversary $\sdv$. For simplicity, we only consider unidirectional channels, however, we note 
that our functionality can be easily extended to support bidirectional channels. 
\MESSAGEP{We might want to do an intuitive argument of how to extend it or avoid this point.}
\MESSAGEE{If we make use of an ideal functionality that implements bi-directional payment channel networks, then this becomes trivial, as we just use the interfaces of that ideal functionality for updates in both directions. Does $\FF_{\GC}$ support this?} 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ makes use of $\FF_{\GC}$ and $\FF_{\mathsf{GDC}}$, 
hence, it is defined in $(\FF_{\GC}, \FF_{\mathsf{GDC}})$-hybrid model. Furthermore, 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ defines various data structures and operations explained below. 
Our ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ can be seen in \cref{fig:ideal-mppcn}.

\paragraph{Data Structures} 
In order to simplify the presentation of our ideal functionality, we define several data 
structures:
%where a data structure can be global or payment-specific. Global means that the 
%data structure is initialized once and updated throughout the lifetime of the system, and it 
%is available to every operation of the ideal functionality. On the other hand, payment-specific 
%means that the ideal functionality initializes a new empty copy of the corresponding data 
%structure with every new payment, and therefore, the data structure is only available to 
%the payment operation. Our data structures are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item List $\DD$, which records all off-chain transaction related data per multi-path 
	payment. Each entry of $\DD$ is indexed by a user identifier $U$, and the entries have the 
	format $(\gamma_i,U_i,v_i,t_i)$, where $\gamma_i$ is the channel between user $U$ and $U_i$, 
	$U_i$ is the identifier of the payer, $v_i$ is the payment value, and $t_i$ is the 
	associated timeout. More precisely, $\DD[U]$ stores data related to all transactions, 
	where $U$ is the payee of the transaction. 
	\item List $\LL$, which keeps track of lock identifiers. Similar to the list $\DD$ it is 
	also indexed by a user identifier. More precisely, $\HH[U]$ refers to all lock identifiers 
	$\lid$ in the current multi-path payment, where $U$ is either the left or right party of 
	the lock.
	\item List $\RR$, which keeps track of all the users to whom a user $U$ pays. Similar to 
	the previous lists, it is also indexed by a user identifier, and every entry is a set 
	of other user identifiers. More precisely, $\RR[U]$ is the set of all the users with 
	whom $U$ has a transaction, and in that transaction $U$ is the payer.
	\item List $\VV$, which keeps track of the amount of coins each user is supposed to 
	receive during a multi-path payment. Similar to the previous lists, it is also indexed 
	by a user identifier. The value $\VV[U]$ corresponds to the total amount of coins the 
	user $U$ is supposed to receive after a successful execution of a multi-path payment.
	\item List $\UU$, which keeps track of all the users involved in the multi-path payment.
	\item Queue $\QQ$, which keeps track of the remaining transactions in the multi-path payment.
	\item Set $\JJ$, which keeps track of the users who aborted during the execution of 
	a multi-path payment. Hence, it only stores the user identifiers.
\end{itemize}

\MESSAGEE{Operations paragraph is obsolete for now, and will be updated once we decide on 
the final version of the ideal functionality.}
\paragraph{Operations}
%In \cref{fig:ideal-mppcn} we describe the interactions between $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ and the 
%users of the PCN. The execution starts with $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ initializing a local empty 
%set $\CC$, and empty list $\LL$. Users of the PCN can query $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ on $\open$ 
%interface to open new payment channels, and query on $\close$ interface to close them to any 
%valid state that is in $\LL$. The multi-path payment operation is initiated with a call to 
%$\mathsf{pay}$ interface by user $U_s$ (sender) on input a payment value $v$ and receiver 
%identifier $U_r$. Then, $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ checks whether all the channels on the paths 
%have enough capacity and whether the intermediaries allow the payments. If these conditions are 
%satisfied $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ initiates the multi-path payment (step 1). Once the payment has 
%reached the receiver, each user can again decide to interrupt the flow of the payment or not 
%(step 2). Lastly, $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ informs the involved nodes that the operation was 
%successful, and adds the updated channel states to $\LL$ (step 3).

\begin{figure*}[!t]

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{

%\textbf{Open Channel:} On input $(\open, \sid, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, U', t, f)$ from a 
%user $U$, $\FF$ checks whether $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ is well-formed (i.e., contains valid 
%identifiers and it is not a duplicate), and sends $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ 
%to $U'$ and $\sdv$, where $U'$ can either abort or authorize the operation. In the latter case, 
%$\FF$ appends the tuple $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ to $\BB$ via $\FF_{\BB}$ and 
%$(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, h)$ to $\LL$, for some random $h$. Finally, $\FF$ sends $h$ 
%to $U, U'$ and $\sdv$. \\
%
%\textbf{Close Channel:} On input $(\close, \sid, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, h)$ from a user $U$ 
%or $U'$, the ideal functionality $\FF$ parses $\BB$ via $\FF_{\BB}$ for an entry 
%$(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ and $\LL$ for an entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t', 
%h)$ for $h \neq \bot$. If $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle} \in \CC$ or $t' > |\BB|$ or $t' > |\BB|$, 
%then $\FF$ aborts. Otherwise, $\FF$ adds the entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t')$ to 
%$\BB$ via $\FF_{\BB}$ and adds $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ to $\CC$. Lastly, $\FF$ sends 
%$(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, \bot, h)$ to $U, U'$ and $\sdv$. \\

\textbf{Multi-Path Payment:} On input $(\mathsf{Pay}, U_r, v, \{(\cid_s^1, U_s^1,v_s^1,t_s^1),
\ldots,(\cid_s^{k_s}, U_s^{k_s},v_s^{k_s},t_s^{k_s})\})$ from a user $U_s$, $\FF$ proceeds 
as follows 
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Initializes the queue $\QQ$, set $\JJ$ and lists $\DD, \LL, \RR, \VV, \UU$ as empty.
	\item If the input set of $U_s$ is empty or $\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{k_s} v_s^i < v$, then 
	$\FF$ aborts.
	\item Otherwise, for all $i \in [1,k_s]$, it enqueues $(\cid_s^i, U_s,U_s^i,v_s^i,t_s^i)$ 
	to $\QQ$, adds $U_s^i$ to $\RR[U_s]$ and $U_s$ to $\UU$.
	\item Sends \NEWE{$(\mathsf{InitRoute},U_r)$ to $\sdv$}.
	\item Receives $\vec{\id} := (\id_1(U_r),\ldots,\id_k(U_r))$ from $\sdv$.
	\item Sends \NEWE{$(\Setup,U_r,v)$ to $\sdv$}.
	\item Receives $(\vec{\ell},\vec{\td})$ from $\sdv$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item While $\QQ$ is not empty, $\FF$ does the following
	\begin{itemize}[label=-]

		%\item If a channel with identifier $\cid_i$ does not exists, then $\FF_{\GC}$ return 
		%$\bot$, and $\FF$ aborts.

		%\cid_i$.
		\item Sends \NEWE{$(\Lock,U_r,\vec{\ell},U_i,v_i)$ to $\sdv$}.
		\item Receives $b$ from $\sdv$.
		\item If $b = \bot$, then $\FF$ aborts.
		\item Otherwise, $\FF$ adds $\lid_i$ to $\LL[U^*]$ and $\LL[U_i]$, and sets $\VV[U_i] = 
		\VV[U_i] + v_i$.

		(\cid_i^{k_i},U_i^{k_i},v_i^{k_i},t_i^{k_i})\})$.
		\item Then, for all $j \in \{1,\ldots,k_i\}$, $\FF$ enqueues 
		$(\cid_i^j,U_i,U_i^j,v_i^j,t_i^j)$ to $\QQ$, and adds $U_i^j$ to $\RR[U_i]$.

hybrid model}

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:mppcn-discussion}

We introduce and discuss the security and privacy notions of interest for our 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ functionality.

\paragraph{Balance Security}
Balance security roughly means that an intermediary receives \emph{at least} as many coins as 
it forwards, and that it can pull its coins as soon as \emph{at least} one of its right 
neighbors has pulled. We assume that the first part of this property is enforced by the 
environment by considering rational users, which when they splits, they do not split to a 
total value that is more than they are supposed to receive. \MESSAGEE{We can make an explicit 
check for this in the ideal functionality.} The second part is achieved in step 2 of 
$\mathsf{Pay}$ interface, which guarantees that the only way a payment will fail 
for a user is if all of its right neighbors have aborted. Hence, the user has no one right 
neighbor that pulled.

\paragraph{Value Privacy}
Value privacy means that the value of a transaction between two non-compromised users cannot 
be determined. Our ideal functionality achieves this property as it does not contact any user 
who does not lie in the payment path, and for each transaction only the involved parties are 
contacted. 
\MESSAGEP{Ideally, we should recall the definitions that we had for credit networks and adjust them for PCN. Source here: \url{https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/04_3_2.pdf}}

\MESSAGEE{If the adversary is in both paths when a split happened, does he even know that both paths are part of the same payment? We can try to build value privacy and relationship anonymity based on this observation.}

\paragraph{Completeness}
Completeness means that the receiver cannot start pulling the coins before it has received 
enough transactions, whose sum amount equals the total coins he is supposed to receive by 
the sender. Our ideal functionality keeps track of the amount of coins each user in the 
multi-path payment will receive in the list $\VV$, and it performs a check at the beginning of 
step 2 of the $\mathsf{pay}$ interface to make sure that the amount of coins the receiver will 
receive equals the amount with which the sender invoked the $\mathsf{pay}$ interface. Hence, our 
ideal functionality achieves this property as well.

\paragraph{Relationship Anonymity}
Relationship anonymity roughly means that any two simultaneous payments over the same path (or 
multi-path) for the same value (and splitting in case of multi-path payment) are 
indistinguishable to the eyes of the intermediaries as long as there exists \emph{at least} 
one honest users in the path (or per path in case of multi-path payment). 
\MESSAGEP{As before with value privacy, it would be good to refer to that definition of credit networks and also the one in PCN (CCS'17)}
This is achieved by 
our ideal functionality as every intermediate user only receives a unique identifier for 
each payment, and such an identifier is independent from the identifiers of other users involved 
in the same payment.

\subsection{Multi-Path Multi-Hop Locks (MPMHL)}
\label{sec:mpmhl}

In the following we define an ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ for {\sysname}s, which 
models the cryptographic lock functionality. Similar to $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$, our ideal 
functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ also works in interaction with a universe of users 
$\mathbb{U}$.
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ makes use of $\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}$ and $\FF_{\syn}$, thus, it is 
defined in $(\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}, \FF_{\syn})$-hybrid model. The data structures and 
operations that $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ defines are shown below. Our ideal functionality 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ is found in \cref{fig:ideal-mpmhl}.

\paragraph{Data Structures}
Our ideal functionality uses the following data structures internally:

\begin{itemize}
	\item List $\LL$, which is initialized as empty list and is used to track the locks. 
	The entries of $\LL$ are of the form $(\lid_i, \td_i, U_i, U_j, f, \\ \lid_{i+1})$, 
	where $\lid_i$ is unique lock identifier, $\td_i$ is the trapdoor of the lock, $U_i$ 
	and $U_j$ are the users connected by the lock (the left and right user, respectively), 
	$f \in \{\Init,\Lock,\Rel\}$ is a status flag of the lock, and $\lid_{i+1}$ is the 
	identifier of the next lock on the path. We note that the trapdoors are only associated 
	to the initial locks created from the sender, and in all subsequent locks on the path the 
	trapdoor is set to $\bot$. However, since our list $\LL$ has a linked structure (includes 
	the next lock identifier), we can recursively traverse the list of locks on the path to 
	obtain the trapdoor associated to the path.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Operations}
In \cref{fig:ideal-mpmhl} we define the ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ with its 5 
interfaces. The $\Setup$ interface allows the user $U_0$ (the sender) to setup states and 
trapdoors to be used later when establishing and releasing the locks. The $\Lock$ interface 
allows a user to establish locks with its right neighbors using the previously established 
locks. The $\Extract$ interface allows the user $U_n$ (the receiver) to release the locks that it 
received using the initially created trapdoors. The $\Release$ interface allows an intermediate 
user along the path to release the locks with its left neighbors assuming its right locks are 
released. Lastly, $\mathsf{GetStatus}$ interface allows a user to check the current status of 
a lock. We note that internally the locks are assigned identifiers that are unique across all 
paths.

For ease of exposition we also define several functions that extract or update information of 
a lock given its identifier as input: $\getStatus(\cdot)$ returns the status of the lock, 
$\getLeft(\cdot)$/$\getRight(\cdot)$ return the left/right user involved with the 
lock, $\getNextLock(\cdot)$ returns the identifier of the next lock, $\setRightUser(\cdot, U)$ 
sets the right user of the lock to a user $U$, $\setRightLock(\cdot, \lid^*)$ sets the right lock 
of the given lock to $\lid^*$, $\updateStatus(\cdot, f)$ sets the status of the lock to a flag 
$f$, $\generateTrapdoor(\cdot)$ creates a trapdoor associated to the lock, and 
$\validateTrapdoors((\cdots), (\td_1,\ldots,\td_m))$ checks that the trapdoors are associated 
to the given locks by recursively traversing the path of each given lock.

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:mpmhl-discussion}

We define the security and privacy notions of interest for {\sysname}s, and describe how they 
are captured by the functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$.

\TODOP{Add ACID properties.}

\paragraph{Consistency} A \sysname is consistent if no user can release its left lock without its 
right lock being released first. Our ideal functionality captures this property as the $\Release$ 
interface allows a user to release the left lock only if the corresponding right lock has already 
been released. In case the user is the receiver, the $\Extract$ interface is used for releasing, 
and it makes sure that there are no further right locks before starting the release of the 
provided locks.

\MESSAGEE{But in our actual protocol we have a wormhole attack, so consistency should not 
quite hold. Need to get rid of this, and modify the ideal functionality accordingly.}

\paragraph{Atomicity} Atomicity means that every user in any path is able to release its left 
lock only if the corresponding right lock is already released. Our ideal functionality enforces 
this by keeping track of all the locks in the list $\LL$, and in the $\Release$ interface only 
changes the status of a lock to $\Rel$ if the corresponding next lock is already released (i.e., 
has flag $\Rel$). If the user is the receiver, then the $\Extract$ interface validates that no 
right lock exists.

\paragraph{Completeness} A \sysname is complete if the receiver can only start releasing its 
locks, once it has received same number of locks as the trapdoors (i.e., the receiver has 
received all the locks intended for him). More precisely, our ideal functionality generates 
$v$ trapdoors in the $\Setup$ interface, and in the $\Extract$ interface the release can only 
begin if the receiver has $v$ locks as well.

\paragraph{Relationship Anonymity} Relationship anonymity requires that each intermediate user 
cannot distinguish two simultaneous multi-hop locks with the same sender and receiver. This is 
achieved by our ideal functionality as the lock identifiers are sampled at random, and during 
the locking phase a user only learns the identifiers of its left and right locks. Since the 
identifiers are independent the property follows.

\MESSAGEE{In our protocols we only achieve relationship anonymity as long as one intermediary is 
honest. And what about anonymity in the sense that a user cannot distinguish if it is part of a 
single-path or multi-path lock?}
