\section{Security and Privacy Model}
\label{sec:security-model}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:model-prelims}

We formalize the security and privacy notions of a multi-path payment channel network (MPPCN) 
and multi-path multi-hop locks (\sysname). We make use of the universal composability (UC) 
framework of Canetti \cite{canetti}.

\paragraph{Attacker Model}
We model parties as interactive Turing machines (ITMs), which communicate with a trusted 
functionality $\FF$ via secure and authenticated communication channels. We model the 
adversary $\adv$ as a $\ppt$ machine that has access to an interface $\corrupt(\cdot)$, 
which takes as input a party identifier $P$ and provides the attacker with the internal 
state of $P$. From that point onward, all subsequent incoming and outgoing communication 
of $P$ is routed through $\adv$. We consider the static corruption model, that is, the 
adversary is required to commit to the identifiers of the parties it wishes to corrupt 
ahead of time.

\paragraph{Communication Model}
Communication happens through the secure transmission functionality $\FF_{\smt}$, as 
defined in \cite{canetti}, which informs the adversary whenever a communication between 
any two parties happens, and allows the adversary to delay the delivery of the messages 
arbitrarily. However, the adversary can neither read nor change the content of the messages.

We consider a synchronous communication network, where communication proceeds in discrete 
rounds, as defined in \cite{kmtz} and denoted here as $\FF_{\syn}$. The parties are 
always aware of the current round, and if a party $P$ sends a message in round $r$, 
the recipient receives the message in the beginning of round $r + 1$. The 
adversary can change the order of messages, but we assume that the order of messages 
between honest parties cannot be changed (which can easily be realized using message 
counters). For simplicity, we assume that computation is instantaneous.

Furthermore, we assume existence of an anonymous communication channel as defined in 
\cite{cl}, which we denote here as $\FF_{\anon}$. In the ideal functionality we use the 
interfaces send$_\smt$ and receive$_\smt$ to exchange messages through the $\FF_{\smt}$ 
functionality, and interfaces send$_\anon$ and receive$_\anon$ to exchange messages via 
$\FF_{\anon}$.

\paragraph{Ledger Functionality}
We assume existence of a blockchain $\BB$, modeled as a trusted append-only bulletin board. 
The corresponding ideal functionality $\FF_{\BB}$, as modeled in \cite{perun}, is used to 
store, read and update the payment channels and balance of every user. It is defined in the 
global UC (GUC) model \cite{guc}, since it provides data that should be globally accessible, 
and it can be updated by multiple instances of our ideal functionality or by other protocols 
simultaneously. We denote the number of entries in $\BB$ as $|\BB|$, and we model time as the 
number of entries of the blockchain $\BB$ (i.e., time $t = |\BB|$).

\paragraph{Universal Composability}
We now review the notion of secure realization in the UC framework~\cite{canetti}. 
Intuitively, a protocol realizes an ideal functionality if the adversary has no way 
to distinguish between the ideal functionality and the real-world protocol, where 
a simulator is in charge of translating the messages produced by the ideal functionality 
for the computational adversary. Here $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ denotes the ensemble of 
the outputs of the environment $\dist$ when interacting with the adversary $\adv$ and 
users running protocol $\pi$.

\begin{definition}[Universal Composability]
A protocol $\pi$ UC-realizes an ideal functionality $\FF$ if for any $\ppt$ adversary 
$\adv$ there exists a simulator $\sdv$, such that for any environment $\dist$, the 
ensembles $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ and $\exec_{\FF, \sdv, \dist}$ are computationally 
indistinguishable.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Multi-Path Payment Channel Network (MPPCN)}
\label{sec:mppcn}

In this section we define an ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ for MPPCNs. 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ works in interaction with a universe of users $\mathbb{U}$, which 
corresponds to the users of the PCN. To ease the exposition, we assume that there is a 
well-ordering to the users in a sense that a user $U_i$ can only transact with user $U_j$ 
if $j > i$ for $i,j \in \NN$. For simplicity, we only consider unidirectional channels, 
however, we note that our functionality can be easily extended to support bidirectional 
channels. $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ makes use of $\FF_{\BB}$, $\FF_{\anon}$ and $\FF_{\syn}$, 
hence, it is defined in $(\FF_{\BB}, \FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\syn})$-hybrid model. Furthermore, 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ defines various data structures and operations explained below. 
Our ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ can be seen in \cref{fig:ideal-mppcn}.

\paragraph{Data Structures} 
In order to simplify the presentation of our ideal functionality, we define the following 
data structures, which are used internally by the ideal functionality:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Set $\CC$, which keeps track of all closed channels locally. The entries in $\CC$ 
	are of the form $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$, which corresponds to the channel identifier.
	\item List $\LL$, which records the off-chain payments locally. The entries in $\LL$ are 
	defined as $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, h)$, where $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ is the 
	corresponding channel identifier, $v$ is the amount of credit used, $t$ is the expiration 
	time of the payment, and $h$ is the identifier for this entry.
	\item List $\DD$, which records all off-chain transactions per multi-path payment. Since it 
	is defined per payment each call to $\mathsf{pay}$ interface initialized a new empty list 
	$\DD$. Each entry of $\DD$ is indexed by a user identifier $U$, and the entries have the 
	same format as the entries of the list $\LL$. More precisely, $\DD[U]$ corresponds to all 
	the transactions in the current multi-path payment where $U$ is the payer of the transaction. 
	\item List $\HH$, which keeps track of off-chain payment identifiers. Similar to the list 
	$\DD$, it is also defined per user and per multi-path payment. More precisely, $\HH[U]$ 
	refers to all payment identifiers $h$ in the current multi-path payment, where $U$ is the 
	payer of the payment.
	\item List $\VV$, which keeps track of the amount of coins each user is supposed to receive 
	during a multi-path payment. Same as $\DD$ and $\HH$ it is defined per user and per 
	multi-path payment. The value $\VV[U]$ corresponds to the total amount of coins the user $U$ 
	is supposed to receive after a successful execution of a multi-pay payment.
	\item Set $\JJ$, which keeps track of the users who aborted during the execution of 
	multi-path payment. It is also defined per multi-path payment, hence, the ideal functionality 
	creates a new empty set $\JJ$ after every call to the $\mathsf{pay}$ interface.
\end{itemize}
	
\paragraph{Operations}
In \cref{fig:ideal-mppcn} we describe the interactions between $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ and the 
users of the PCN. The execution starts with $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ initializing a local empty 
set $\CC$, and empty list $\LL$. Users of the PCN can query $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ on $\open$ 
interface to open new payment channels, and query on $\close$ interface to close them to any 
valid state that is in $\LL$. The multi-path payment operation is initiated with a call to 
$\mathsf{pay}$ interface by user $U_0$ (sender) on input a payment value $v$ and receiver 
identifier $U_{n+1}$. Then, $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ checks whether all the channels on the paths 
have enough capacity and whether the intermediaries allow the payments. If these conditions are 
satisfied $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ initiates the multi-path payment (step 1). Once the payment has 
reached the receiver, each user can again decide to interrupt the flow of the payment or not 
(step 2). Lastly, $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ informs the involved nodes that the operation was 
successful, and adds the updated channel states to $\LL$ (step 3).

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{

\textbf{Open Channel:} On input $(\open, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, U', t, f)$ from a user 
$U$, $\FF$ checks whether $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ is well-formed	(i.e., contains valid 
identifiers and it is not a duplicate), and replies with $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ 
to $U'$, who can either abort or authorize the operation. In the latter case, $\FF$ appends 
the tuple $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ to $\BB$ and $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, 
t, h)$ to $\LL$, for some random $h$. Finally, $\FF$ returns $h$ to $U$ and $U'$. \\

\textbf{Close Channel:} On input $(\close, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, h)$ from a user $U$ or $U'$, 
the ideal functionality $\FF$ parses $\BB$ for an entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ and 
$\LL$ for an entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t', h)$ for $h \neq \bot$. If $c_{\langle 
U,U' \rangle} \in \CC$ or $t' > |\BB|$ or $t' > |\BB|$, then $\FF$ aborts. Otherwise, $\FF$ 
adds the entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t')$ to $\BB$ and adds $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ 
to $\CC$. Lastly, $\FF$ notifies both $U$ and $U'$ with a message $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, 
\bot, h)$. \\

\textbf{Multi-Path Payment:} On input $(\mathsf{pay}, v, U_{n+1})$ from a user $U_0$, $\FF$ 
initializes the set $\JJ$ and lists $\DD, \HH, \VV$ as empty, sets $\VV[U_0] = v$, and executes 
the following interactive protocol:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all $i \in \{0,\ldots,n\}$, $\FF$ sets $v_i = \VV[U_i]$, sends $(\mathsf{get-}
	\mathsf{split}, v_i)$ to $U_i$, who replies with $(\mathsf{split}, \{(U_i^1,v_i^1,t_i^1),
	\ldots,(U_i^{k_i},v_i^{k_i},t_i^{k_i})\})$ for $1 \leq k_i \leq n$. If the set is empty \textcolor{red}{or $\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} v_i^j 
	\geq v_i$}, then $\FF$ aborts. Otherwise, for all $j \in \{1,\ldots,k_i\}$, $\FF$ samples a 
	random $h_i^j$, and parses $\BB$ for an entry of the form $(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, 
	v^*, t^*, f^*)$. If such an entry exists, then $\FF$ sends the tuple $(h_i^j, c_{\langle 
	U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v_i^j, t_i^j)$ to the user $U_i^j$ via an anonymous communication 
	channel, who replies either with $\top$ or $\bot$. In the latter case, $\FF$ aborts. 
	Otherwise, $\FF$ adds $h_i^j$ to $\HH[U_i^j]$, sets $\VV[U_i^j] = \VV[U_i^j] + v_i^j$, 
	and checks whether for all entries of the form $(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, 
	v^*, \cdot, \cdot) \in \LL$, it holds that $v^* \geq v_i^j$. If this is the case $\FF$ 
	adds $d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle},v^* - v_i^j, t_i^j, \bot)$ to $\DD[U_i]$. where 
	$(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v^*, \cdot, \cdot) \in \LL$ is the entry with the lowest 
	$v^*$. Lastly, if any of the conditions above is not met or $\VV[U_{n+1}] \neq v$, then 
	$\FF$ aborts.
	
	\item For all $i \in \{n+1,\ldots,1\}$, $\FF$ queries $U_i$ with $\HH[U_i]$ through an 
	anonymous communication channel. Each user can reply either with $\top$ or $\bot$. If 
	$U_i$ replies with $\bot$, then $\FF$ add $U_i$ to $\JJ$.
	
	\item For all $i \in \{n,\ldots,0\}$, $\FF$ parses the entries of $\DD[U_i]$ as 
	$d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v', t_i^j, \bot)$, and creates a set 
	$\mathcal{R}$, which is composed of all user identifiers $U_i^j$. Next, $\FF$ checks 
	whether $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \JJ$. If this is the case, then $\FF$ adds $U_i$ to $\JJ$, 
	and notifies $U_i$ with the message $(\bot, h_i^j)$. Otherwise, $\FF$ updates $d_i^j$ as 
	$d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v', t_i^j, h_i^j)$, adds $d_i^j$ to $\LL$, and 
	notifies $U_i$ with the message $(\top, h_i^j)$.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:mppcn-discussion}

We introduce and discuss the security and privacy notions of interest for our 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$ functionality.

\paragraph{Balance Security}
Balance security roughly means that an intermediary receives \emph{at least} as many coins as 
it forwards, and that it can pull its coins as soon as \emph{at least} one of its right 
neighbors has pulled. The first part of this property is achieved by our ideal functionality 
in step 1 of $\mathsf{pay}$ interface, by making sure that the when a user splits, it cannot 
split to a value more than it is supposed to receive (text in red). The second part is achieved 
in step 3 of $\mathsf{pay}$ interface, which guarantees that the only way a payment will fail 
for a user is if all of its right neighbors have aborted. Hence, the user has no one right 
neighbor that pulled.

\paragraph{Value Privacy}
Value privacy means that the users who are not part of a payment do not learn the transacted 
value. Our ideal functionality achieves this property as it does not contact any user who does 
not lie in the payment path. 
%Furthermore, assuming there has been at least one split in the payment path, and there are not colluding users on different paths, then learning the transacted value is not possible even for the intermediaries involved in the payment.
\MESSAGEE{Is our value privacy per multi-path or we also define it per path? Since if there is 
a split then no user in other path should learn the transacted value even per path.}

\paragraph{Completeness}
Completeness means that the receiver cannot start pulling the coins before it has received 
enough transactions, whose sum amount equals the total coins he is supposed to receive by 
the sender. Our ideal functionality keeps track of the amount of coins each user in the 
multi-path payment will receive in the list $\VV$, and it performs a check in step 1 of 
$\mathsf{pay}$ interface to make sure that the amount of coins the receiver will receive equals 
the amount with which the sender invoked the $\mathsf{pay}$ interface. Hence, our ideal 
functionality achieves this property as well.

\paragraph{Relationship Anonymity}
Relationship anonymity roughly means that any two simultaneous payments over the same path (or 
multi-path) for the same value (and splitting in case of multi-path payment) are 
indistinguishable to the eyes of the intermediaries as long as there exists \emph{at least} 
one honest users in the path (or per path in case of multi-path payment). This is achieved by 
our ideal functionality as every intermediate user only receives a unique identifier for 
each payment, and such an identifier is independent from the identifiers of other users involved 
in the same payment.

\subsection{Multi-Path Multi-Hop Locks (MPMHL)}
\label{sec:mpmhl}

In the following we define an ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ for {\sysname}s, which 
models the cryptographic lock functionality.

Similar to $\FF_{\mathsf{MPPCN}}$, our ideal functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ also works 
in interaction with a universe of users $\mathbb{U}$.  Our $\FF_{\sysname}$ 
ideal functionality can be seen in \cref{fig:ideal-func}.

$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ makes use of $\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}$ and $\FF_{\syn}$, thus, it is 
defined in $(\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}, \FF_{\syn})$-hybrid model. The data structures and 
operations that $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ defines are shown below. Our ideal functionality 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ is found in \cref{fig:ideal-mpmhl}.


 Additionally, 
$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ initializes an empty list $\LL := \emptyset$, which is used to track the 
locks. The entries of $\LL$ are of the form $(\lid_i, \td_i, U_i, U_j, f, \\ \lid_{i+1})$, 
where $\lid_i$ is unique lock identifier, $\td_i$ is the trapdoor of the lock, $U_i$ and $U_j$ 
are the users connected by the lock (the left and right user, respectively), $f \in \{\Init,\Lock,
\Rel\}$ is a status flag of the lock, and $\lid_{i+1}$ is the identifier of the next lock on the 
path. We note that the trapdoors are only associated to the initial locks created from the sender, 
and in all subsequent locks on the path the trapdoor is set to $\bot$. However, since our list 
$\LL$ has a linked structure (includes the next lock identifier), we can recursively traverse the 
list of locks on the path to obtain the trapdoor associated to the path.

For ease of exposition we define several functions that extract or update information of a 
lock given its identifier as input: $\getStatus(\cdot)$ returns the status of the lock, 
$\getLeft(\cdot)$ and $\getRight(\cdot)$ return the left and right user involved with the 
lock, $\getNextLock(\cdot)$ returns the identifier of the next lock, $\setRightUser(\cdot, U)$ 
sets the right user of the lock to a user $U$, $\setRightLock(\cdot, \lid)$ sets the right lock 
of the lock to $\lid$, $\updateStatus(\cdot, f)$ sets the status of the lock to a flag $f$, 
$\generateTrapdoor(\cdot)$ creates a trapdoor associated to the lock, and $\validateTrapdoors
((\cdots), (\td_1,\ldots,\td_m))$ checks that the trapdoors are associated to the given locks 
by recursively traversing the path of each given lock.

$\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$ defines 5 interfaces. The $\Setup$ interface allows the user $U_0$ (the sender) 
to setup states and trapdoors to be used later when establishing and releasing the locks. The $\Lock$ 
interface allows a user to establish locks with its right neighbors using the previously established 
locks. The $\Extract$ interface allows the user $U_n$ (the receiver) to release the locks that it 
received using the initially created trapdoors. The $\Release$ interface allows an intermediate user 
along the path to release the locks with its left neighbors assuming its right locks are released. 
Lastly, $\mathsf{GetStatus}$ interface allows a user to check the current status of a lock. We note 
that internally the locks are assigned identifiers that are unique across all paths.

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:mpmhl-discussion}

We define the security and privacy notions of interest for {\sysname}s, and describe how they 
are captured by the functionality $\FF_{\mathsf{MPMHL}}$.

\TODOP{Add ACID properties.}

\paragraph{Consistency} A \sysname is consistent if no user can release its left lock without its 
right lock being released first. Our ideal functionality captures this property as the $\Release$ 
interface allows a user to release the left lock only if the corresponding right lock has already 
been released. In case the user is the receiver, the $\Extract$ interface is used for releasing, 
and it makes sure that there are no further right locks before starting the release of the provided 
locks.

\MESSAGEE{But in our actual protocol we have a wormhole attack, so consistency should not quite hold?}

\paragraph{Atomicity} Atomicity means that every user in any path is able to release its left lock 
only if the corresponding right lock is already released, and furthermore, the receiver can only start extracting once it has received all the locks intended for him. Our ideal functionality enforces this by 
keeping track of all the locks in the list $\LL$, and in the $\Release$ interface only changes the 
status of a lock to $\Rel$ if the corresponding next lock is already released (i.e., has flag $\Rel$). 
If the user is the receiver, then the $\Extract$ interface validates that no right lock exists, and that the number of locks received is equal to the number of trapdoors that the receiver has (i.e., the receiver has received all the locks intended for him). Only if these conditions are satisfied the release can start.

\MESSAGEE{Atomicity receiver: only if all subpaths get to him, and honest users don't lose money.}
\paragraph{Anonymity} Anonymity requires that each intermediate user does not learn any information 
about the set of users in a \sysname beyond its direct neighbors.
%and furthermore, it cannot distinguish if it is part of a single-path or multi-path lock. 
This is achieved by our ideal functionality since the lock identifiers are sampled at random, and 
during the locking phase a user only learns the identifiers of its left and right locks, along with 
its left and right neighbors.

\MESSAGEE{In our protocols we only achieve relationship anonymity as long as one intermediary is 
honest. And what about anonymity in the sense that a user cannot distinguish if it is part of a 
single-path or multi-path lock.}

\paragraph{Completeness} A \sysname is complete if the receiver can only start releasing its locks,
once it has received same number of locks as the trapdoors. More precisely, our ideal functionality 
generates $v$ trapdoors in the $\Setup$ interface, and in the $\Extract$ interface the release can 
only begin if the receiver has $v$ locks as well.
