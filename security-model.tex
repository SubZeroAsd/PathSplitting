\section{Security Model}
\label{sec:security-model}

\TODOE{Threat model, communication model, ...}

\TODOE{Write Ideal Functionality for both locks (multiple-trapdoor and single-trapdoor). Ideally, we have one ideal functionality 
where we highlight the few differences.}

In this section, we formalize the security and privacy notions of \sysname. We make use of 
the universal composability (UC) framework of Canetti \cite{canetti}.

\subsection{Attacker Model}
\label{sec:attacker-model}

We model parties as interactive Turing machines (ITMs), which communicate with a trusted 
functionality $\FF$ via secure and authenticated communication channels. We model the 
adversary $\adv$ as a $\ppt$ machine that has access to an interface $\corrupt(\cdot)$, 
which takes as input a party identifier $P$ and provides the attacker with the internal 
state of $P$. From that point onward, all subsequent incoming and outgoing communication 
of $P$ is routed through $\adv$. We consider the static corruption model, that is, the 
adversary is required to commit to the identifiers of the parties it wishes to corrupt 
ahead of time.

\subsection{Ideal Functionality}
\label{sec:ideal-func}

\paragraph{Communication Model}
Communication happens through the secure transmission functionality $\FF_{\smt}$, as 
defined in \cite{canetti}, which informs the adversary whenever a communication between 
any two parties happens, and allows the adversary to delay the delivery of the messages 
arbitrarily. However, the adversary can neither read nor change the content of the messages.

We consider a synchronous communication network, where communication proceeds in discrete 
rounds, as defined in \cite{kmtz} and denoted here as $\FF_{\syn}$. The parties are 
always aware of the current round, and if a party $P$ sends a message in round $r$, 
the recipient receives the message in the beginning of round $r + 1$. The 
adversary can change the order of messages, but we assume that the order of messages 
between honest parties cannot be changed (which can easily be realized using message 
counters). For simplicity, we assume that computation is instantaneous.

Furthermore, we assume existence of an anonymous communication channel as defined in 
\cite{cl}, which we denote here as $\FF_{\anon}$. In the ideal functionality we use the 
interfaces send$_\smt$ and receive$_\smt$ to exchange messages through the $\FF_{\smt}$ 
functionality, and interfaces send$_\anon$ and receive$_\anon$ to exchange messages via 
$\FF_{\anon}$.

\paragraph{Our Model}
In the following we define an ideal functionality $\FF_{\sysname}$ for {\sysname}s. For a 
more modular treatment, we only model the cryptographic lock functionality.

\MESSAGEP{Do we consider unidirectional or bidirectional links?}

$\FF_{\sysname}$ works in interaction with a universe of users $\mathbb{U}$. Additionally, 
$\FF_{\sysname}$ initializes an empty list $\LL := \emptyset$, which is used to track the 
locks. The entries of $\LL$ are of the form $(\lid_i, \td_i, U_i, U_j, f, \\ \lid_{i+1})$, 
where $\lid_i$ is unique lock identifier, $\td_i$ is the trapdoor of the lock, $U_i$ and $U_j$ 
are the users connected by the lock (the left and right user, respectively), $f \in \{\Init,\Lock,
\Rel\}$ is a status flag of the lock, and $\lid_{i+1}$ is the identifier of the next lock on the 
path. We note that the trapdoors are only associated to the initial locks created from the sender, 
and in all subsequent locks on the path the trapdoor is set to $\bot$. However, since our list 
$\LL$ has a linked structure (includes the next lock identifier), we can recursively traverse the 
list of locks on the path to obtain the trapdoor associated to the path.

For ease of exposition we define several functions that extract or update information of a 
lock given its identifier as input: $\getStatus(\cdot)$ returns the status of the lock, 
$\getLeft(\cdot)$ and $\getRight(\cdot)$ return the left and right user involved with the 
lock, $\getNextLock(\cdot)$ returns the identifier of the next lock, $\setRightUser(\cdot, U)$ 
sets the right user of the lock to a user $U$, $\setRightLock(\cdot, \lid)$ sets the right lock 
of the lock to $\lid$, $\updateStatus(\cdot, f)$ sets the status of the lock to a flag $f$, 
$\generateTrapdoor(\cdot)$ creates a trapdoor associated to the lock, and $\validateTrapdoors
((\cdots), (\td_1,\ldots,\td_m))$ checks that the trapdoors are associated to the given locks 
by recursively traversing the path of each given lock.

$\FF_{\sysname}$ defines 5 interfaces. The $\Setup$ interface allows the user $U_0$ (the sender) 
to setup states and trapdoors to be used later when establishing and releasing the locks. The $\Lock$ 
interface allows a user to establish locks with its right neighbors using the previously established 
locks. The $\Extract$ interface allows the user $U_n$ (the receiver) to release the locks that it 
received using the initially created trapdoors. The $\Release$ interface allows an intermediate user 
along the path to release the locks with its left neighbors assuming its right locks are released. 
Lastly, $\mathsf{GetStatus}$ interface allows a user to check the current status of a lock. We note 
that internally the locks are assigned identifiers that are unique across all paths. Our $\FF_{\sysname}$ 
ideal functionality can be seen in \cref{fig:ideal-func}.

$\FF_{\sysname}$ makes use of $\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}$ and $\FF_{\syn}$, thus, it is defined in 
$(\FF_{\anon}, \FF_{\smt}, \FF_{\syn})$-hybrid model.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\TODOP{Add ACID properties.}

We define the security and privacy notions of interest for {\sysname}s, and describe how they 
are captured by the functionality $\FF_{\sysname}$.

\paragraph{Consistency} A \sysname is consistent if no user can release its left lock without its 
right lock being released first. Our ideal functionality captures this property as the $\Release$ 
interface allows a user to release the left lock only if the corresponding right lock has already 
been released. In case the user is the receiver, the $\Extract$ interface is used for releasing, 
and it makes sure that there are no further right locks before starting the release of the provided 
locks.

\MESSAGEE{But in our actual protocol we have a wormhole attack, so consistency should not quite hold?}

\paragraph{Atomicity} Atomicity means that every user in any path is able to release its left lock 
only if the corresponding right lock is already released, and furthermore, the receiver can only start extracting once it has received all the locks intended for him. Our ideal functionality enforces this by 
keeping track of all the locks in the list $\LL$, and in the $\Release$ interface only changes the 
status of a lock to $\Rel$ if the corresponding next lock is already released (i.e., has flag $\Rel$). 
If the user is the receiver, then the $\Extract$ interface validates that no right lock exists, and that the number of locks received is equal to the number of trapdoors that the receiver has (i.e., the receiver has received all the locks intended for him). Only if these conditions are satisfied the release can start.

\MESSAGEE{Atomicity receiver: only if all subpaths get to him, and honest users don't lose money.}
\paragraph{Anonymity} Anonymity requires that each intermediate user does not learn any information 
about the set of users in a \sysname beyond its direct neighbors.
%and furthermore, it cannot distinguish if it is part of a single-path or multi-path lock. 
This is achieved by our ideal functionality since the lock identifiers are sampled at random, and 
during the locking phase a user only learns the identifiers of its left and right locks, along with 
its left and right neighbors.

\MESSAGEE{In our protocols we only achieve relationship anonymity as long as one intermediary is 
honest. And what about anonymity in the sense that a user cannot distinguish if it is part of a 
single-path or multi-path lock.}

\paragraph{Completeness} A \sysname is complete if the receiver can only start releasing its locks,
once it has received same number of locks as the trapdoors. More precisely, our ideal functionality 
generates $v$ trapdoors in the $\Setup$ interface, and in the $\Extract$ interface the release can 
only begin if the receiver has $v$ locks as well.

\subsection{Universal Composability}
\label{sec:uc}

We now review the notion of secure realization in the UC framework~\cite{canetti}. 
Intuitively, a protocol realizes an ideal functionality if the adversary has no way 
to distinguish between the ideal functionality and the real-world protocol, where 
a simulator is in charge of translating the messages produced by the ideal functionality 
for the computational adversary. Here $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ denotes the ensemble of 
the outputs of the environment $\dist$ when interacting with the adversary $\adv$ and 
users running protocol $\pi$.

\begin{definition}[Universal Composability]
A protocol $\pi$ UC-realizes an ideal functionality $\FF$ if for any $\ppt$ adversary 
$\adv$ there exists a simulator $\sdv$, such that for any environment $\dist$, the 
ensembles $\exec_{\pi, \adv, \dist}$ and $\exec_{\FF, \sdv, \dist}$ are computationally 
indistinguishable.
\end{definition}

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{

\textbf{Open Channel:} On input $(\open, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, U', t, f)$ from a user 
$U$, $\FF$ checks whether $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ is well-formed	(i.e., contains valid 
identifiers and it is not a duplicate), and replies with $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ 
to $U'$, who can either abort or authorize the operation. In the latter case, $\FF$ appends 
the tuple $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ to $\BB$ and $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, 
t, h)$ to $\LL$, for some random $h$. Finally, $\FF$ returns $h$ to $U$ and $U'$. \\

\textbf{Close Channel:} On input $(\close, c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, h)$ from a user $U$ or $U'$, 
the ideal functionality $\FF$ parses $\BB$ for an entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v, t, f)$ and 
$\LL$ for an entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t', h)$ for $h \neq \bot$. If $c_{\langle 
U,U' \rangle} \in \CC$ or $t' > |\BB|$ or $t' > |\BB|$, then $\FF$ aborts. Otherwise, $\FF$ 
adds the entry $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, v', t')$ to $\BB$ and adds $c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}$ 
to $\CC$. Lastly, $\FF$ notifies both $U$ and $U'$ with a message $(c_{\langle U,U' \rangle}, 
\bot, h)$. \\

\textbf{Payment:} On input $(\mathsf{pay}, v, U_{n+1})$ from a user $U_0$, $\FF$ initializes 
the set $\JJ$ and lists $\DD, \HH, \VV$ as empty, sets $\VV[U_0] = v$, and executes the following 
interactive protocol:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all $i \in \{0,\ldots,n\}$, $\FF$ sets $v_i = \VV[U_i]$, sends $(\mathsf{get-}
	\mathsf{split}, v_i)$ to $U_i$, who replies with $(\mathsf{split}, \{(U_i^1,v_i^1,t_i^1),
	\ldots,(U_i^{k_i},v_i^{k_i},t_i^{k_i})\})$. If the set is empty or $\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} v_i^j 
	\neq v_i$, then $\FF$ aborts. Otherwise, for all $j \in \{1,\ldots,k_i\}$, $\FF$ samples a 
	random $h_i^j$, and parses $\BB$ for an entry of the form $(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, 
	v^*, t^*, f^*)$. If such an entry exists, then $\FF$ sends the tuple $(h_i^j, c_{\langle 
	U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v_i^j, t_i^j)$ to the user $U_i^j$ via an anonymous communication 
	channel, adds $h_i^j$ to $\HH[U_i^j]$ and sets $\VV[U_i^j] = \VV[U_i^j] + v_i^j$. 
	Next, $\FF$ checks whether for all entries of the form $(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, 
	v^*, \cdot, \cdot) \in \LL$, it holds that $v^* \geq v_i^j$. If this is the case $\FF$ 
	adds $d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle},v^* - v_i^j, t_i^j, \bot)$ to $\DD[U_i]$. where 
	$(c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v^*, \cdot, \cdot) \in \LL$ is the entry with the lowest 
	$v^*$. Lastly, if any of the conditions above is not met or $\VV[U_{n+1}] \neq v$, then 
	$\FF$ aborts.
	
	\item For all $i \in \{n+1,\ldots,1\}$, $\FF$ queries $U_i$ with $\HH[U_i]$ through an 
	anonymous communication channel. Each user can reply either with $\top$ or $\bot$. If 
	$U_i$ replies with $\bot$, then $\FF$ add $U_i$ to $\JJ$.
	
	\item For all $i \in \{n,\ldots,0\}$, $\FF$ parses the entries of $\DD[U_i]$ as 
	$d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v', t_i^j, \bot)$, and creates a set 
	$\mathcal{R}$, which is composed of all user identifiers $U_i^j$. Next, $\FF$ checks 
	whether $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \JJ$. If this is the case, then $\FF$ adds $U_i$ to $\JJ$, 
	and notifies $U_i$ with the message $(\bot, h_i^j)$. Otherwise, $\FF$ updates $d_i^j$ as 
	$d_i^j = (c_{\langle U_i,U_i^j \rangle}, v', t_i^j, h_i^j)$, adds $d_i^j$ to $\LL$, and 
	notifies $U_i$ with the message $(\top, h_i^j)$.
