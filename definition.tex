\section{Definitions}

\paragraph{Consistency} Consistency means that no party can release its left lock without its 
right lock being release first.

\paragraph{Atomicity} Atomicity means that the receiver can only start to release its locks, once it 
has received all the locks intended for him in a given protocol run, and furthermore, every user in 
any path is able to release its left lock only if its right lock is already released. 

\paragraph{Anonymity} Anonymity means that each intermediate node does not learn any information about 
the set of users in a protocol run beyond its direct neighbors, and furthermore, it cannot distinguish 
if it is part of a single-path or multi-path lock.

\paragraph{Completeness?} The release algorithm returns either $\bot$ or $\vec{k} := (k_1,\ldots,
k_v)$, for a payment value $v$ established in the setup procedure.
