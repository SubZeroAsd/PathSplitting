Interledger protocol --> that you do not need to have a lock in the first place
Spider network --> Read and add

On-chain privacy ---> At the very least, pairings help for the privacy (blockchain shows the conditions)

Routing... you can hide the receiver by sending it encrypted to the landmark

Add Boomerang to the related work

Try to fix ILP --> What happens if something goes wrong? Accountability


 2) Multi-path name bad --> non-source more prominent

Contributions:


 1) Impossibility of having non-unit amount payments

 2) construction compatible with Bitcoin (and many cryptocurrencies)

 3) construction compatible with Ethereum 

 4) cross-chain routing with privacy

 5) implementation details
 
 
 diagrams for the actual splitting and for the routing!
 
 informally check that if both bilinear map and DLog are
